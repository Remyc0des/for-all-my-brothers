<h1>FOR ALL MY BROTHERS</h1>
<p1>The for all my brothers project is dedicated to the 
millions of lives lost, and ruined from police brutality,
its goal is to create a centralized site to report, monitor,
and expose corrupt not just officers but organizaitons, poloticians,
local goverments, and those who aim to harm the comunity. We are doing 
more then just saying the names of the ones we lost, we honor thier legacy 
with this data base, lettting them know they did not die in vain.
